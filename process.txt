* I made two ... the commented out functions are for <a href> tags (I misread any tags in the instructions)

My initial thought process was:

== Get Data via Http/Https Get => Parse Data for Links ==

=== function DownloadWebPage() ===
Since http requests are asynchronous in nature, I made a function that returns a promise with the http response data.
0) I used Postman to GET request as well in order to confirm any problems from the node http request / to double check received data against my own
1) Added User-Agent for rare sites that deny anonymous requests
2) Added recursion loop up to 5 reattempts for destination for temporary redirection (300 - 399 status codes) 
3) basic err handling

=== Parsing ===

So first thing I did is go on web mdn to get an updated list of url attributes. I tried to peruse through all the relevant ones -- skipping
all the ones that are 'deprecated'. Since the task was to get all links (regardless of tags), the idea was to get all relevant attributes and filter them out:
1) Split the data string by 'space', and look for relevant attribute tags with `xxx="` (ie href=" or src=") and store into array
    1a) Find the indexOf said attributes and filter the string by `"` assuming that all links start and end with `"`
        1a.e) href="xxxxxxxxxx" w/ split == ['href=', xxxxxxxxx, '']
    1b) Get split[1] and if it doesn't exist return -1

2) Now I filtered the string we got from (1) with some arbitrary "rules" I found by looking at page html via console:
    1) If string started with http or https ... simply return split[1] else...
        1a) All routes must include special characters (#, ./, /, etc)
        1b) If the first character is not #, ./, assume it's not following route "protocol"
    2) Join the filtered string to the url based on console link format (see ****)

3) With all the (hopefully) filtered links, run values through Set to filter out redundancies
    and console.log/console.table


3b) For the commented out parts, I basically did above but parsed by the <a> tag and I used 
    cheerio and **** function below to test my results against. 

**** I ran this through browser console to get links
    var array = [];
    var links = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
    for(var i=0, max=links.length; i<max; i++) {
        if(links[i].href != "") array.push(links[i].href);
    }

    let unique = [...new Set(array)];
    console.log(unique);
